# **MaldiGut Reference Database**
MaldiGut is a reference database that contains mass spectrum profiles (MSPs) and is especially focused on human gut bacterial species. This database can be used to analyze mass spectrometry data of bacterial species obtained with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation coupled to a time-of-flight analyzer (MALDI-TOF MS).

## Description
This database contains 132 MSPs in total of bacteria that are isolated from human fecal samples:
+ 125 _Firmicutes_ species.
+ 3 _Bacteroidetes_ species.
+ 3 _Actinobacteria_ species.
+ 1 _Verrucomicrobia_ species.


The database is provided as .btmsp format, which is only compatible with Bruker Daltonics mass spectrometry software.
